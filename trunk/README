* Introduction

tcliaxc is a Tcl extension which provides you access to iax voip protocol
via iaxclient library. tcliaxc lets you use a Tcl package to do basic iax
operations such as registering to a server, make a call, handle iax event
and so on.

tcliaxc ia a free software licensed under the BSD license terms.

* Developers

tcliaxc developers are:

bugant  - bugant@users.berlios.de
sickpig - sickpig@users.berlios.de

for any additional info feel free to contact them.

* Requirements

tcliaxc needs iaxclient library (http://iaxclient.sf.net) to get it just
checkout it from its svn:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iaxclient iaxclient

* Installation

tcliaxc uses autotools to build, so, in the simplest
case you'd just type the usual ./configure; make;
make install commands sequence.

If iaxclient library is placed out of ld scope you need to provide to
configure script the right flags:

./configure LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/iaxclientlib CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/iaxclientlib

If you need to rebuild configure script, just use
autoconf.

stay tuned!
